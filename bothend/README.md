Graffiti Relay TodoMVC application
---

[Running version](https://graffiti-todo.herokuapp.com/)

This is an example application using [graffiti-mongoose](https://github.com/RisingStack/graffiti-mongoose).
You only need to specify your Mongoose schemas, and graffiti will handle the rest.
It will generate the GraphQL schema supporting queries and mutations compatible with [Relay](https://github.com/facebook/relay).
